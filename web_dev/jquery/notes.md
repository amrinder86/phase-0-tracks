 Spend 10 minutes making a plan for how you intend to tackle jQuery and learn as much as you can in two hours. What sorts of resources will help? How often should you stop and test what you just learned? Are breaks important? Make a few notes in the file on how you plan to approach the topic, and why.

 I'll google the topic first and save some good cheatsheets and then look for videos on it.I'll see how long they videos are. If they are more than 30 minutes long then I'll watch one and get the idea about the language and check my cheatsheet to see how much of it I understand now after watching the video. If the videos are shorter like 10-15 minutes then I'll watch 4-5 and see how I do after watching them.
 For two hours I'll only take breaks if I'm not getting or understanding anything or stuck on something If I'm following along video. If I'm learning what is being shown to me then no breaks in between 2 hours.

 After watching videos in first hour and saving some websites about jquery,I would like to go over my notes and what I need to research more on.I'll then google all those topics that I can in next one hour and read up on them.

 After about 2 hrs 
 Watched few 15 min videos about Jquery and then watched some this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWXggB-T1jQ
 Jquery seems really fun to work with.
