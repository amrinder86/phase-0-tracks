 Hello Emmanuel

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
```
It keeps a log of each update made to the repository.If for any reason you lose of mess up your code with version control you can always go the the last working update and when it was updated etc. So basically it keeps a log of your code in cloud at various saves.It's kind of like windows restore point to fix your pc but in cloud not on local machine:)
```
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
```
Branch is basically a playground for developers to work on new features and ideas without messing with the original code in master repository. branches are really awesome for working on teams and solo because this way you can work more freely and develop the original code into something that will make it more better or powerful depending on solo or team projects. it basically gives you more freedom to work your way on a project and present your thoughts and ideas for others to debate.
```
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
```
Commit is basically a save. good commit will be a clear udpate on what was changed during that commit so you and other people depending on team or solo have a better idea about what was changed.
```
* What is a merge conflict?
```
Merge conflict is when 2 or more people working on something same change the same file and then try to merge that file into master repository.
Basically when 2 branches that have changed the same part of the same file and when they try to merge them together it creates merge conflict.
