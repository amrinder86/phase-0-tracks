What is the difference between a GET request and a POST request? When might each be used?

GET is used to retrieve data, and POST is used to update/submit data.
 
GET basically requests data Requests data from a specified resource and can be cached and it's parameters remain in browser history While POST on the other side submits the data to be processed to a specified source and can't be cached, it's parameters are not saved in browser history.
