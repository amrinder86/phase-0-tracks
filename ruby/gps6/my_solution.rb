# Reflection Section
# 2 different hash syntaxes used in STATE_DATA hash are string and symbols
# require_relative
# it basically links the external files to the file we are trying to connect it to.
# require compared to require_relative is less useful and it might have hard time finding files
# that are not in same directory. I would say require_relative is more powerful.
# to iterate through a hash we can use each and map but not map!
# Instant variables stood out when refactoring virus affects.
# Topics I learned today would be "private"..how to make methods private so they are not
# accessible outside the class and more clarification on instant variables.
