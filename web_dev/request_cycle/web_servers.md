What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?

Acc. to my research Linux is small and well layed out and all of the programs in it do their job very well.It's portable and affordable.Shell scripts increase leverage and portability
Design and build software, even operating systems, to be tried early, ideally within weeks. 

In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?

I think VPS is virtual computer with no hardware that is sold to a user with operating system on it so user can do stuff on it and have other people connect/access to it if they want to and make it act as server.
VPS are very affordable,very customizable and we can scale them quick as needed.
 
 Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?

 It's considered bad because since you have administrative access if you mess up somewhere and delete something valuable that will take more time to fix it and there is a possibility of having no fix to it.
 or  a bug that exits on server and that gives access to ROOT some outsider.

It's good practice on any operating system to run your applications on a user level and leave administrative tasks to the root user.
